The titanic dataset reveals that passengers, class, age and sex were significant factors in determining survival rates. Passengers in higher classes, women and children were more likely to survive while passengers in lower classes, men and those travelling alone were less likely to survive.

RECOMMENDATIONS:
•	Prioritize the evacuation of women, children and passengers in higher classes.

•	Provide additional support and resources to passengers in lower classes and those travelling alone.

•	Develop emergency response plans that take into account the social and demographic characteristics of passengers.

CONCLUSION: 
  The titanic dataset provides valuable insights into factors influencing survival rates, informing strategies for emergency response and saving lives.
